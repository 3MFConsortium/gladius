# ApplicationMCPAdapter Refactoring Summary

## Problem
The `ApplicationMCPAdapter.cpp` file has grown to over 3,800 lines with 50+ methods, violating single responsibility principle and making maintenance difficult.

## Solution: Tool-Based Architecture

### Core Concept
Replace the monolithic adapter with specialized tool classes, each handling a specific domain of functionality.

### Tool Classes Proposed

1. **ApplicationLifecycleTool** - Application state management
2. **DocumentManagementTool** - Document operations (with async support)
3. **FunctionOperationsTool** - Function creation and manipulation
4. **NodeGraphTool** - Node graph operations and parameters
5. **ResourceManagementTool** - 3MF resource management
6. **SceneHierarchyTool** - Scene inspection
7. **RenderingTool** - Rendering operations
8. **ValidationTool** - Model validation
9. **UtilityTool** - Maintenance operations

### Base Classes

- **MCPToolBase**: Common validation, error handling, Application reference
- **AsyncMCPToolBase**: Extends MCPToolBase with CoroMCPAdapter support

### Key Benefits

- **Single Responsibility**: Each tool has one clear purpose
- **Better Testing**: Tools can be unit tested independently
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes localized to specific tools
- **Code Reuse**: Common patterns in base classes
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Create base classes and infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Implement tools (simple â†’ complex)
3. **Phase 3**: Refactor main adapter to delegate to tools
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize and document

### Risk Mitigation

- Maintain all existing public interfaces
- Comprehensive regression testing
- Gradual implementation with rollback options
- Performance monitoring throughout

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this architectural approach
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Create unit test framework for tools
4. Implement tools incrementally with continuous testing

This refactoring will transform the codebase into a more maintainable, testable, and extensible architecture while preserving all existing functionality.

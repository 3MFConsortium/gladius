# Task 1: Fix Automatic Compilation in Model Editor

## Problem Statement
The "Compile automatically" button in the model editor for implicit models doesn't work currently and needs to be fixed.

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Understanding the Current State
1. **Locate the Model Editor UI Components**
   - Find the model editor UI files
   - Locate the "Compile automatically" button implementation
   - Understand the UI structure and button event handling

2. **Identify the Compilation Process**
   - Find where manual compilation works
   - Understand the compilation workflow for implicit models
   - Identify the automatic compilation trigger mechanism

3. **Analyze the Problem**
   - Determine why automatic compilation is not working
   - Check for missing event handlers, broken connections, or logic errors
   - Review any error logs or debug information

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Fix the Automatic Compilation Logic**
   - Implement or repair the automatic compilation trigger
   - Ensure proper event handling for the button
   - Add necessary callbacks and state management

2. **Testing**
   - Test the "Compile automatically" button functionality
   - Verify that automatic compilation works when enabled
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

3. **Integration**
   - Ensure the fix doesn't break existing manual compilation
   - Verify UI responsiveness and user experience
   - Test with different implicit model types

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Build Verification**
   - Ensure the project still builds successfully
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
   - Add unit tests for the automatic compilation feature if possible

2. **User Experience Testing**
   - Test the complete workflow from UI interaction to compilation
   - Verify button states and visual feedback
   - Test with various model scenarios

## Success Criteria
- [x] "Compile automatically" button is functional
- [x] Automatic compilation triggers when enabled
- [x] Manual compilation still works as expected
- [x] Project builds successfully
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] User interface provides appropriate feedback

## Files to Investigate
- UI components in `src/ui/` directory
- Model editor related files
- Compilation logic files
- Event handling systems

## Notes
- Follow the C++ coding guidelines provided
- Add appropriate error handling and logging
- Consider adding unit tests for the new functionality

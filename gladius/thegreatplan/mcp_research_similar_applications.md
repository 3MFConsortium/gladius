## Best Practices for Design Application APIs

### 1. Data Model Design

#### 1.1 Object Hierarchy
```
Document
├── Assembly
│   ├── BuildItems
│   └── Functions
├── Resources
│   ├── Meshes
│   ├── Textures
│   └── Materials
└── Settings
    ├── ViewSettings
    └── RenderSettings
```

#### 1.2 Identifier Strategy

- Support both numeric IDs and human-readable names
- Maintain ID consistency across save/load cycles
- Provide ID translation for imported objects

### 2. Operation Design Patterns

#### 2.1 Command Pattern
```cpp
class Operation {
public:
    virtual ~Operation() = default;
    virtual bool execute() = 0;
    virtual bool undo() = 0;
    virtual std::string getDescription() const = 0;
};

class OperationHistory {
public:
    void executeOperation(std::unique_ptr<Operation> op);
    bool undo();
    bool redo();
    void clear();
};
```

#### 2.2 Validation Strategy
- Validate parameters before execution
- Provide detailed error messages with suggestions
- Support dry-run mode for complex operations
- Implement rollback for failed operations

### 3. Communication Patterns

#### 3.1 Request/Response Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique-request-id",
  "method": "tool_name",
  "params": {
    "parameter1": "value1",
    "parameter2": "value2"
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Progress Reporting
```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "progress": {
    "current": 50,
    "total": 100,
    "message": "Processing mesh optimization...",
    "cancellable": true
  }
}
```

#### 3.3 Error Handling
```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_PARAMETER",
    "message": "Parameter 'radius' must be positive",
    "details": {
      "parameter": "radius",
      "value": -1.5,
      "min_value": 0.001
    }
  }

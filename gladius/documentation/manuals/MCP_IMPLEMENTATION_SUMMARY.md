# MCP Tool Set Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

Based on the insights from the user guide, I've improved the MCP server tools to provide better workflow guidance for AI agents who may not be familiar with Gladius or have access to the source code.

### 1. Enhanced Tool Descriptions

**Before**: Generic descriptions like "Create a new empty document"

**After**: Workflow-focused descriptions that include:
- **WORKFLOW CONTEXT**: Where this tool fits in the Gladius workflow
- **PREREQUISITES**: What must exist before using this tool  
- **NEXT STEPS**: What to do after using this tool
- **TEMPLATE INTEGRATION**: How the template.3mf simplifies the workflow

### 2. Workflow Phase Organization

The `list_tools` command now organizes tools by workflow phase:

1. **Phase 1 - Project Management**: Create/open documents
2. **Phase 2 - Function Creation**: Define shapes with mathematical expressions
3. **Phase 3 - Boolean Operations**: Combine shapes using union/intersection/difference
4. **Phase 4 - Export**: Generate 3MF files for 3D printing
5. **Utility Tools**: Ping, status, diagnostics
6. **Advanced Tools**: Specialized functions for expert users

### 3. Workflow Guidance in Status

The `get_status` tool now provides workflow guidance:
- If no document: Suggests `create_document` 
- If document exists: Suggests `create_function_from_expression`
- Explains that template.3mf includes pre-configured Level Set and Build Item

### 4. Key Workflow Insights Incorporated

Based on the user guide analysis:

#### Template.3mf Advantage
- **Level Sets**: Not created automatically - template already contains one
- **Build Items**: Template already contains one that references the Level Set  
- **Mesh Domain**: Template includes mesh for evaluation domain
- **Ready to Use**: Users can immediately create functions and export

#### Boolean Operations Reality
- **No Union Node**: Uses `Min()` operation with signed distance functions
- **Intersection**: Uses `Max()` operation  
- **Difference**: Uses `Max(A, -B)` pattern
- **3MF Compliant**: Only uses standard mathematical nodes from 3MF specification

#### Function Creation Priority
- **Mathematical Expressions**: Most flexible approach
- **SDF Formulas**: Box uses `length(max(abs(pos - center) - size/2, 0.0))`
- **Common Patterns**: Sphere, box, gyroid examples provided
- **No Internal Nodes**: Avoids BoxMinMax and other internal implementations

## Benefits for AI Agents

### 1. Clear Workflow Understanding
AI agents now understand the logical sequence:
```
create_document → create_function_from_expression → create_csg_union → export_3mf_with_implicit
```

### 2. Reduced Decision Paralysis
Instead of 30+ undifferentiated tools, agents see:
- 4 core workflow phases
- Clear prerequisites and next steps
- Typical usage patterns

### 3. Template Awareness
Agents understand that new projects come with:
- Level Set already configured
- Build Item already configured  
- Just need to create functions and export

### 4. 3MF Compliance
Tool descriptions emphasize:
- Standard 3MF nodes only
- No internal implementation details
- Boolean operations using Min/Max pattern

## Example AI Agent Usage

**Before improvement:**
```
AI: I have 30+ tools, which should I use?
User: Create a box with gyroid lattice
AI: Should I create Level Set? Build Item? Not sure...
```

**After improvement:**
```
AI: I see 4 workflow phases. Let me start:
1. create_document (loads template with Level Set/Build Item ready)
2. create_function_from_expression for box: "length(max(abs(pos) - vec3(1,1,1), 0.0))"  
3. create_function_from_expression for gyroid: "sin(pos.x)*cos(pos.y) + ..."
4. create_csg_union to combine them
5. export_3mf_with_implicit for final file
```

## Implementation Files Modified

1. **`src/mcp/MCPServer.cpp`**:
   - Enhanced tool descriptions with workflow context
   - Added workflow phase organization to `list_tools`
   - Added workflow guidance to `get_status`
   - Emphasized template.3mf advantages

2. **`documentation/manuals/MCP_TOOL_IMPROVEMENTS.md`**:
   - Complete analysis and recommendations
   - Tool categorization strategy
   - Benefits for AI agents

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Prerequisite Validation**: Tools could check if prerequisites are met
2. **Smart Defaults**: Suggest reasonable parameter values  
3. **Workflow Macros**: Single tools that perform multi-step operations
4. **Usage Analytics**: Track which tools are used together
5. **Error Recovery**: Better guidance when tools fail

## Result

The MCP server is now transformed from a collection of disparate tools into a guided workflow system that helps AI agents understand and use Gladius effectively, even without prior knowledge of the application or access to source code.

Key workflow insight: **Template.3mf eliminates the complexity of Level Sets and Build Items - AI agents can focus on the core task of creating mathematical functions to define shapes.**
